# Main Code of the Ninja-Turtlebot
The robot is set to accomplish two fairly different tasks. First being auto-navigation inside a confined maze, second being target detection and shooting.

## TurtleBot Package Requirements
These code is meant to run in a [TurtleBot3 - Burger](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/specifications/) along with [ROS Kinetic Kame](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic) running on Ubuntu 16.04.
Before using these python scripts, a pre-installation of the following programs must be done:
### [TurtleBot3 Setup](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/setup/#setup)
### [TurtleBot3 Bringup](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/bringup/#ros-1-bringup)
### [SLAM with Rviz](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/slam/#ros-1-slam)


## Auto Navigation
Accomplished using running G5_auto_nav3.py



## Target Detection and Shooting
Accomplished using G5_go_and_shoot4.py, G5_shooter.py, and G5_camera.py
